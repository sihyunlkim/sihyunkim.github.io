Project Name Lost in the Arts Center
Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create?
The overall concept of the website is to essentially serve as an interactive “guidebook” to help the audience navigate through the various aspects of the film Lost in the Arts Center, a 30 MFF that depicts the narrative of the “common experience” of NYUAD students getting lost in the Arts Center. The website I created serves as a dedicated platform for showcasing Lost in the Arts Center in a way that enhances the viewing experience, providing a place to watch the film and a space for deeper engagement with the project’s themes and production process. Inspired by different streaming platforms, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the website’s content is organized in a sleek, user-friendly layout that encourages seamless exploration. Consisting of six main pages—Home, About, Videos, Cast & Crew, Photos, and Rate—the site is structured to deliver an intuitive browsing experience, allowing users to effortlessly access the film, view related content, and explore additional features.
Process: How did you go about implementing the concept?
Since the website for this project had to be built around the video Haris and I took for the 30 MFF video assignment, I thoroughly re-watched the video we made. And I realized that our video was like a movie trailer. So, at first, I came up with the idea of coming up with typical movie review websites (e.g. Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB), where you could access all movie-related information in 1-2 web pages. However, while wireframing, I thought that creating a website in the form of a guidebook, where the user can easily access different pages using either menu bars or previous and next buttons, would better help the user navigate the content and engage with the project's themes. Also, wireframing helped me to determine what pages I should have for the website.
Before starting to build the website, I had to explore HTML, JavaScript, and CSS as it was my first time coding with these languages. The class code examples and CHATGPT were a great help in understanding and getting familiar with these languages. 
I started with building the general HTML code structure for each page, as recommended by the professor. This involved creating a basic framework that would allow for easy navigation and content organization across the site. 
Once the HTML structure was in place, I created website layouts, including fonts and pictures, using Canva as a reference for styling each page. Canva allowed me to experiment with different design elements and visualize how the final website would look. By choosing fonts, color schemes, and images that matched the feel of the film, I was able to establish a clear and consistent look for the website.
These design mockups were very useful when it came to applying CSS. I used the layouts I made to guide the styling on the actual website, making sure that each page looked the way I planned. In designing the overall aesthetics of the website, I was influenced by existing streaming platforms such as Netflix and Apple TV. Since I designed the layout of each page to be different from one another, coding in CSS took the longest time. The various design elements in CSS, like margins, paddings, and flexbox properties, were initially very confusing to me. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to align everything correctly, and I found myself needing a lot of help from ChatGPT, especially at the start. With ChatGPT's guidance, I slowly got the hang of positioning elements, creating responsive layouts, and refining the visual details. 
The most challenging part of this project was definitely styling the pages. I particularly found styling the home page (index page) to be the hardest. One of the key elements I wanted to include was a curved text for the film's title to give it a unique and visually appealing look. However, this proved to be quite difficult to achieve, even with online resources. I used a resource from CSS-Tricks to help me create the curved text effect (a resource I used: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/svg/curved-text-along-path/), but it still required a lot of trial and error to get it right. Aligning the text perfectly was a particular challenge, but after a few hours of struggling, I was able to achieve the desired effect.






After styling the pages, I started to code the JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to the website. Since I learned JavaScript in Introduction to Interactive Media last semester, it was way easier to code than the other 2 languages. JavaScript enabled pop-up of the modal in the Cast page and overall rating system on the Rate page. The rate page especially depended on the JavaScript. It enabled star rating selection, form submission handling, and displaying saved opinions.
In the process of coding, CHATGPT helped me a lot in debugging. As I was new to these coding languages, whenever I received unexpected errors, I did not know what to do, but CHATGPT helped me a lot in figuring out the errors and debugging them. 
Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
Comparing my final version with the wireframe I made, I think it changed a lot. While the initial concept I thought of still maintains the same, which was to make an “interactive guidebook” website for the film, the layout changed a lot. 
While the concept of using the previous and next buttons to navigate the pages remained the same, I decided to make a change to the site’s navigation structure. Initially, I had included a small circle row at the bottom of each page, which allowed users to jump to any page they wanted. However, after further consideration, I realized that this method might not provide the best user experience, especially for a site designed to guide users through content in a more structured manner.
To improve navigation, I removed the circle row and added a more traditional navigation bar at the top of the website. This navigation bar provides a clear and consistent way for users to access different sections of the site, such as Home, About, Videos, Cast & Crew, Photos, and Rate, from anywhere on the site. I think this change enhanced the user experience by offering both the flexibility to move between pages as needed and a guided path through the site’s content. 
Also, I changed some design layouts of the website. I thought that putting the title of the film everywhere might be a little redundant and unnecessary, so I only put the title of the film on the pages I think I have to put. Also,  I removed that “big rectangle frame” in every page except for video page. The reason behind removing the frame was simply because it looked better when I was making a reference design for the website in Canva. 
My goal and expectation for this project was very simple, to create an interactive guidebook for the film, which is easy to navigate and aesthetically pleasing. That being said, I think I achieved my goal and expectations for this project. I am honestly very satisfied with the output I made, as it is easy to use and is very aesthetically pleasing.
